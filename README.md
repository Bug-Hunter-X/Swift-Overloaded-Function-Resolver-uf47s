This repository demonstrates a common error in Swift programming: the 'ambiguous use of function' error. This occurs when the compiler encounters a function call that could match multiple function signatures. The provided code shows this error and the solution.  The solution involves using type casting or more specific function signatures to resolve the ambiguity.  This is a helpful example for understanding Swift's type system and function overloading.
